# TQ-s-Chairs-Data-Pack
There are many arguments for and against elytras. With a community of players, we thought of a compromise: you can only have the elytra equiped within the range of a beacon. When a beacon effect runs out, the elytra gets transfered to your inventory, so you better have a way to break your fall. This data pack is lag friendly on top of that. The pyramid size and number of beacons also affects the range, so have fun customising your world.
